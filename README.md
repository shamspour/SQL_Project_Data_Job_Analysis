# üìñ Background
Driven by the need to strategically navigate the **data analyst job market**, this project was initiated to identify high-paying and highly demanded skills, aiming to streamline the path for analysts seeking optimal career growth.

The data used in this analysis originates from the [SQL Data Analyst Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA&t=0s) by [lukebarousse](https://github.com/lukebarousse), encompassing detailed job postings with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skill requirements.

## Specifically, I set out to answer the following key questions through SQL queries:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs located in Germany?

2. What skills are required for these top-paying roles?

3. What skills are most in demand across all data analyst positions?

4. Which skills correlate strongly with higher salaries?

5. What are the most optimal skills (high-demand and high-paying) to prioritize learning?


# üõ†Ô∏èTools I Used

Several essential tools and technologies learned during the **SQL Data Analyst Course** played key roles in conducting this analysis:

- **SQL:** Served as the analytical backbone, used extensively for querying data and uncovering critical insights.

- **PostgreSQL:** The database management system selected for its robustness and ease in handling large datasets of job postings.

- **Visual Studio Code:** The primary environment for developing and running SQL queries, ensuring smooth database interactions.

- **Git & GitHub:** Crucial for version control, effective project management, collaboration, and sharing my analysis and SQL scripts.

# üìä The Analysis

Each SQL query in this project was strategically crafted to explore specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Below is how I approached answering each of the key analytical questions:

## 1- Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To uncover the highest-paying roles, I filtered the dataset for positions explicitly titled "Data Analyst", located specifically in Germany, and with clearly stated average salaries. This allowed me to quickly identify top financial opportunities within the German market.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    company_dim.name as company_name,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
where
    job_title_short like '%Data Analyst%' AND
    search_location = 'Germany' AND
    salary_year_avg is NOT NULL
ORDER BY
     salary_year_avg DESC
```

## 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To determine what skills set apart the highest-paid data analyst roles, I joined job postings with their required skills. This analysis reveals exactly what employers value most for high-compensation positions in Germany.

```sql
WITH top_paying_job AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        company_dim.name as company_name,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg
    FROM job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
    where
        job_title_short like '%Data Analyst%' AND
        search_location = 'Germany' AND
        salary_year_avg is NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
)

SELECT
    top_paying_job.*,
    skills_dim.skills as skills_name
FROM top_paying_job
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim on top_paying_job.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim on skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
```

- **SQL** stands out as the most essential skill, required in 31 of the highest-paying job postings.

## 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.
```sql
select 
    skills as skills_name,
    count (skills_job_dim.job_id) as demand_count
from job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim on job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim on skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short LIKE '%Data Analyst%'
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
limit 5
```

I analyzed the skill requirements from all relevant job postings. The results clearly show that foundational technical and analytical skills dominate employer expectations. SQL remains the core requirement for data analysis, while Excel, Python, and modern BI tools like Tableau and Power BI round out the essential skill set for strong employability.

| Skill     | Demand Count |
|-----------|--------------|
| SQL       | 110,380      |
| Excel     | 75,348       |
| Python    | 68,409       |
| Tableau   | 56,569       |

## 4. Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills reveals which specializations are most highly rewarded for data analysts‚Äîacross all locations in the dataset.

```sql
select 
    skills as skills_name,
    round(avg (job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg),0) as avg_salary
from job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim on job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim on skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short LIKE '%Data Analyst%' and
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg is not null
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
limit 25
```
